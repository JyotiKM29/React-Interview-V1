**Q1. What is React?**

React is an `open-source front-end JavaScript library` that is used for building `composable user interfaces`, especially for `single-page applications`. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach.


```
like a toolbox that helps developers create the visual parts of websites or web applications 
```

**Q2. What are the major features of React?**

The major features of React are:

- Uses `JSX syntax`, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
- It uses `Virtual DOM` instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
- Supports `server-side rendering` which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
- Follows `Unidirectional` or one-way data flow or data binding.
- Uses `reusable/composable UI` components to develop the view.

```
 Virtual DOM:
 It keeps a lightweight copy of the web page called the "virtual DOM," which helps it figure out what parts of the page need to change. This makes updates faster and more efficient.
```

```
Component-Based Architecture:
Think of components as building blocks,Each piece does a specific job and can be used over and over again in different combinations to build something larger.
```

```
Unidirectional Data Flow:
This means changes in the data affect how the user interface looks, and when users interact with the interface, it doesnâ€™t directly change the data. 
```
